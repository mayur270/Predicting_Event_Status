# Predicting Event Status on Imbalanced Dataset

This project involves predicting Event Status based on weather condition in different locations. In order to predict event status, I used machine learning algorithms such as 
logistic regression and random forest. Since the dataset is imbalanced, I used the SMOTE technique for replicating data. The html file included in this repository will showcase
the step-by-step process taken.

Data comes from two CSV files(included in this repository) and Dark Sky API. The CSV files includes data such as Location of Event, Event Name, Age limit, Venue Name and Venue Address
whilst weather data such as Temperature and Precipitation comes from Dark Sky API in JSON format.
